### Aligning Growth with National Vision: Carbonatik Meets Sri Lankan Planning Authorities

Carbonatik's commitment to responsible development in Sri Lanka was further solidified through a recent high-level meeting. Our Chief Operating Officer, Anand Malaimegam, and Chief Product Officer, Segar Muthumurugesu, met with key representatives from the **National Physical Planning Department (NPPD)** and the **Urban Development Authority (UDA)**.

The discussions focused on ensuring Carbonatik's current and future mining and resource management activities are closely aligned with Sri Lanka's national physical planning framework and urban development strategies. Topics included sustainable land use, infrastructure integration, and environmental best practices relevant to our operations.

This collaborative engagement is vital for ensuring our projects contribute positively to Sri Lanka's long-term development goals while upholding the highest standards of sustainability.
