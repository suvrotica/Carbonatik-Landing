### A Legacy of Purity: The KGLL Mines

Carbonatik is proud to be at the forefront of revitalizing Sri Lanka's historic graphite mining industry. Our forthcoming **99-year lease on the renowned KGLL mines** positions us to supply the global market with the world's purest form of natural graphite.

Sri Lankan vein graphite is unique, forming in crystalline veins and boasting a carbon content that consistently **exceeds 99%**. This exceptional purity makes it a critical material for high-tech applications, including advanced battery technologies, fuel cells, and high-performance lubricants. We currently have **1,000 tons ready for immediate sale**.

Our commitment is not just to extraction, but to pioneering sustainable and ethical practices that honor the legacy of these historic sites while protecting the environment for future generations.
