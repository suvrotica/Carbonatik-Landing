Carbonatik was honored to participate in high-level discussions with the esteemed delegation from Andhra Pradesh, led by the Hon'ble Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development, Dr. P. Narayana, during his recent investment promotion tour in Dubai.

The dialogue focused on exploring significant investment opportunities within Andhra Pradesh. Representatives from Carbonatik expressed keen interest in the state's **shipbuilding** and **aviation** sectors, where our global expertise in major infrastructure, technology, and mining operations aligns with Andhra Pradesh's ambitious development goals.

We were encouraged by the minister's presentation of the state's investor-friendly policies, commitment to transparent governance, and "Speed of Doing Business" framework.

We thank the Hon'ble Minister and his team for the productive discussion and for the invitation to the upcoming global investors' partnership summit in Visakhapatnam. This meeting reinforces Carbonatik's commitment to strategic growth in India and our enthusiasm for partnering with visionary governments to build world-class infrastructure.
