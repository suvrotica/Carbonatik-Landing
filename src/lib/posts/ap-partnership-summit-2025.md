In a landmark move, Carbonatik LLC has formalized a major investment agreement with the Government of Andhra Pradesh by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at the prestigious CII Partnership Summit 2025 in Visakhapatnam.

The MoU, valued at **₹31,500 crore (US $3.75 billion)**, was signed in the presence of the Hon'ble Chief Minister Shri Nara Chandrababu Naidu. The Carbonatik delegation included our President, **Brendan T. Fitzpatrick**, COO **Anand Malaimegam**, and CPO **Segar Muthumurugesu**.

This strategic investment is projected to create over **30,000 direct and indirect jobs** and is focused on three core sectors:

1.  **Maritime Infrastructure (₹19,100 crore):** Development of a 5G-enabled Greenfield Port, complete with a yacht yard and bonded warehouse facilities on the state's east coast.
2.  **Aviation Cluster (₹7,100 crore):** Establishment of India's largest MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) facility, a cargo terminal, a flight training organization, an advanced simulator centre, and manufacturing units for eVTOLs, drones, and lightweight aircraft at Kurnool Airport.
3.  **Inland Waterways & Water Metro (₹5,300 crore):** Creation of integrated inland waterways for cargo, Ro-Ro/Ro-Pax services, and an Urban Water Metro system for Amaravati and Vijayawada.

Our President, Brendan T. Fitzpatrick, stated that this collaboration reflects Carbonatik's commitment to supporting Andhra Pradesh's “Swarna-Andhra @2047” vision and India’s “Viksit Bharat @2047” goals.

COO Anand Malaimegam noted this significant step was a direct result of the proactive and welcoming response from the state government, which began during our initial meetings in Dubai.
