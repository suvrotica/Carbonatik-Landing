### Strengthening India-Africa Trade Ties: Carbonatik's Contribution

Carbonatik's Chief Operating Officer, Anand Malaimegam, recently participated in a significant discussion with the Indian Trade Commissioner to Africa. This meeting focused on enhancing trade and investment flows between India and the African continent, particularly within the vital resource sector.

Anand Malaimegam provided insights into Carbonatik's extensive operations in Africa, including our activities in Tanzania, Zambia, and the DRC. The conversation explored how Carbonatik's commitment to sustainable mining and robust logistics can contribute positively to the India-Africa economic partnership.

We believe that strengthening these trade corridors is essential for mutual growth and development, and Carbonatik is poised to play a constructive role in this evolving relationship.
